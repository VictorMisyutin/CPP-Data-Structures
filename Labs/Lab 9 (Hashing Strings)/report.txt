For the first file, an a value of 33 was best to reduce the amount of collisions.
For the second file, an a value of 39 was best to reduce the amount of collisions.
For the third file, an a value of 39 was best to reduce the amount of collisions.
For the fourth file, an a value of 41 was best to reduce the amount of collisions.

I am not completly sure why certain values of a yield less collisions
than other values but my guess is that certain prime or odd numbers stop
patterns from occuring when calculating a hash. 

For the first file Quadratic Probing caused less collisions.
For the second file Linear Probing caused less collisions.
For the third file Quadratic Probing caused less collisions.
For the fourth file Quadratic Probing caused less collisions.

So it seems that quadratic probing is more likely to reduce
the amount of collisions when inserting into the hash table.

Clustering occured all over the hash table since there are many words that have similar consonants
and the same vowels, causing similar hash values.

One way that you could improve polynomial hashing is by increasing the size of hasht table
as it gets larger. This would open up more spots for new hashes. However, a down side of This
is that you might have a lot of unused, wasted memory.

Another probing technique that we could have used is double hashing. In double probing
if there is a hashing collision you re calculate the hash using the original hash.

Here is the output of my program:
