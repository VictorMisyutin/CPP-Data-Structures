After running 1000 simulation many times I found that roughly 3600-3700 cycles ensures that all jobs will be
completed in each simulation. The way that I calculate the average number of jobs in the heap per cycle is I add up
the number of jobs in the schedule every cycle, then once the simulation is completed I divide that number by the 
number of cycles it took to complete that simulation. If the simulation was not completed then I divide by the set
maximum number of cycles. If I keep the default of 2700 cycles per simulation I tend to get around 69 completed 
simulations and 931 uncompleted simulations. When there are 2700 cycles per simulation the average number of jobs
processed per failed simulation is 45/46 and the average number of jobs in the heap per cycle is 4. 

When using 3650 cycles for each simulation I get 1000 completed simulations and 0 uncompleted simulations.
The average number of cycles needed to complete 50 jobs is about 3000, but some simulations spike up to 
3500 or more, so having one or two more hundred cycles above ensures the completion of 50 jobs.  

In conclusion, most jobs take 2900 to 3000 cycles. So, setting the number of cycles to 2990 or 3000 will complete
about half of the jobs. If you would like to complete all of the jobs in each simulation keeping the 
number of cycles at a minimum then a value of 3700 should do the trick. However, keep in mind that the jobs calculate length
at random so every once in a while there might be a simulation that will not complete all 50 jobs but this should be pretty rare.
